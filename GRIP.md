**[Task 1]: Prediction using Supervised ML**

<u>Objective:</u> Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.

**[Task 2]: Prediction using Unsupervised ML**

<u>Objective:</u> From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

**[Task 3]:Exploratory Data Analysis - Retail**

<u>Objective:</u> 

* Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Sample Superstore’
* As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit.
* What all business problems you can derive by exploring the data?

**[Task 4:Exploratory Data Analysis - Terrorism]**

<u>Objective:</u> 

*  Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Global Terrorism’
* As a security/defense analyst, try to find out the hot zone of terrorism.
* What all security issues and insights you can derive by EDA?

**[Task 6:Prediction using Decision Tree]**
<u>Objective</u>

*  Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.
* The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
